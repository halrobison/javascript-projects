//String methods can be combined in a process called method chaining.

// let word = 'JavaScript';

// console.log(word.toUpperCase());
//Returns ``JAVASCRIPT``

//What does ``word.slice(4).toUpperCase()`` return?
//Returns "SCRIPT"

//Experiment with other combinations (chains) of string methods.
let fullName = "Elizabeth Bennet"; 
let firstNameLength = fullName.indexOf(" ");
console.log("Your first name is " + firstNameLength + " letters long.");
